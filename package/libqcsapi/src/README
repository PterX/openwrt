The GPL source is created for ASUS wireless router related products.
Please visit the ASUS support site (http://support.asus.com) to get the latest GPL tarball.
It has a lot in common with many wireless router open source projects, including Oleg/Tomato/DD-WRT/OpenWRT.
Thanks the developers of those projects for making the source code available.
